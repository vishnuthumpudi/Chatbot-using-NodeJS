# Chatbot using Node.js

Welcome to the Chatbot using Node.js project! This project utilizes Node.js to create a chatbot application capable of interacting with users through text-based communication.

## Overview

The Chatbot using Node.js project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of building conversational interfaces using Node.js. Leveraging the simplicity and versatility of Node.js, this project provides a platform for creating and deploying chatbots that can engage with users, answer questions, perform tasks, and more.

## Usage

Get your OpenAI API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Create a file named `.env` and add the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOURKEY
```

## Features

- Text-based communication with users through a chat interface
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for understanding user queries
- Customizable responses and actions based on user input
- Scalable and extensible architecture built on Node.js

## Getting Started
